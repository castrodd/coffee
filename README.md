# Coffee Run

An order-tracking prototype for coffeeshops. Built primarily with JavaScript and jQuery.

### Features

Employees can keep track of orders placed and pending through the app. Currently orders are attached to an email address---which at the moment must have an @coffee.org domain---and options included cup size and addtional flavors. There is an easter egg in the app (hint: it is designed for people who really love coffee). Another current quirk is that only one order can be placed per email address. All of the above features are easily customizable.
